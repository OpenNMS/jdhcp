# Introduction

This is a fork of the original jDHCP by [Jason Goldschmidt](https://web.archive.org/web/20170628040932/http://www.advogato.org/person/jgoldsch/).

JDHCP is an application programming interface, written in Java(tm),
for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol as specified in RFC 2131.

For an example of an application written with JDHCP see the dhcpclient in the 
extras directory.
