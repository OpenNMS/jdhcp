README file for JDHCP package

0. Introduction

Thank you downloading the JDHCP package.  JDHCP is an application programming 
interface, written in Java(tm), for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol as
specified in RFC 2131.  JDHCP can be downloaded from 
http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~jgoldsch/dhcp/

In the package you will find the following:

CHANGELOG: listing of all changes made to the JDHCP project since it's
initial release. 

COPYING: license under which JDHCP falls

README: This file

Makefile: provided Makefile for building and installing the JDHCP package
on Unix platforms. Can be edited to work with others though.

api/: directory containing the JDHCP API documentation

classes/: directory used when building the JDHCP jar file

edu/bucknell/net/JDHCP/: directory containing the JDHCP source files

examples/: directory containing example programs written with JDHCP
examples/dhcpclient.java: Simulation of a DHCP client written with JDHCP
examples/README.dhcpclient: Instructions on building and using dhcpclient

jars/: directory containing the JDHCP.jar file

1. Requirements

- JDK 1.1.x or higher 
- gnu make or similar (optional)

If you have Makefile support in your Operating System (ie you have GNU make or 
similar installed), then you can take advantage of the JDHCP Makefile.

2. Compiling JDHCP

Compiling JDHCP is optional, because the JDHCP.jar file is shipped with the JDHCP 
package.  It is located in the <path-to-JDHCP>/jars directory.

If you would like to recompile or compile your own changes to JDHCP do the 
following:

(with make) 

% edit Makefile
% make all

(without make)
(in Unix OS)

% javac -d classes <path-to-JDHCP>/edu/bucknell/net/*.java
% cd classes; jar cvMf ../jars/JDHCP.jar edu/bucknell/net/JDHCP/*.class 


(in Windows)

% javac -d classes <path-to-JDHCP>\edu/bucknell\net\*.java
% cd classes; jar cvMf ..\jars\JDHCP.jar edu\bucknell\net\JDHCP\*.class 

3. Installing JDHCP

(with make)

% edit Makefile 
% (as root or superuser) make install

(w/out make)

copy <path-to-JDHCP>/jars/JDHCP.jar into /usr/local/lib/classes or appropriate 
directory in your CLASSPATH. 

4. Using JDHCP

As long as the JDHCP.jar file is in your CLASSPATH variable, you can compile
a program that uses JDHCP. This can be done by setting the CLASSPATH variable:

In Unix: 

(tcsh) % setenv CLASSPATH <path-to-JDHCP.jar>/JDHCP.jar:$CLASSPATH
(bash) % set CLASSPATH=<path-to-JDHCP.jar>/JDHCP.jar:$CLASSPATH

In Windows 9x/NT:
% set CLASSPATH=<path-to-JDHCP.jar>\JDHCP.jar:$CLASSPATH

or if using JDK 1.2 or higher:

% java(c) -classpath <path-to-JDHCP.jar>/JDHCP.jar progie.java


For an example of an application written with JDHCP see the dhcpclient in the 
example directory.
